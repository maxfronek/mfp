      I designed this piece for a collaboration between LSTN Sound Co. and Chivas Regal in 2016. They commissioned a statement piece to express the shared values of the companies&#58; classic craftsmanship paired with tasteful design.

      The piece is inspired by the two companie's shared values. Recycled copper from a former Chivas barrel is used for the nameplate and inspires the copper accents throughout the piece. Solid American walnut gives extra resonance to the custom-built speakers. Storage for up to 50 LP's, two bottles of Chivas, and a pair of Apolis-designed glasses complete the piece's functionality.

      One of my happiest moments was when the builders saw my plans and said they could get straight to work–no changes or modifications would be needed. The team at <a href="https://whitewallsfab.com/" title="White Walls Fab in Santa Clarita, CA" target="_blank">White Walls Fabrication</a> took the console from paper to reality, and Brian, Tyler, Jordan, and everyone else deserve a huge thanks. This console would not exist without them.

    paragraph: |
      As a part of the partnership, Chivas also commissioned special Troubadour headphones crafted from recycled whiskey casks. Using a burgundy leather and leaving the natural finish of the wood bare, they leave a lasting and distinct impression—just like Chivas. Video content, press pieces, and a launch party were all held to celebrate and promote the partnership. The best part of all? Funds were raised to sponsor a hearing missions in the Dominican Republic where over a thousand people were given hearing aids.
