      Chivas Regal selected LSTN for their 2016 'Made by Gentleman' initiative. To celebrate the partnership, they commissioned a statement piece to express the shared values of the companies&#58; whatever. I was the lucky one who got to design the piece, which was going to be my first-ever piece of furniture as well.
      
      I came up with many ideas in the beginning, from repurposing whiskey barrels to creating a vertical turntable on a curved piece of wood. But I kept coming back to a classic stereo console inspired by midcentury designers like the Eames', Finn Juhl, and more. Just like LSTN's Troubadour headphones or a bottle of Chivas, it would have a timeless appeal. With the final design approved it was time to find a builder.

    paragraph: This copper plate is made from a recycled Chivas whiskey barrel.  The gold accents on the turntable, receiver, and legs of the final unit reflect this heritage as well.

      Some of my initial design drawings. These are the actual plans that <a href="https://whitewallsfab.com/" title="White Walls Fab in Santa Clarita, CA" target="_blank">White Walls Fabrication</a> used to build the pair of consoles. Their team took the console from paper to reality, and Brian, Tyler, Jordan, and everyone else deserve a huge thanks. This console would not exist without them.
