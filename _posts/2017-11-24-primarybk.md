      This client came to me to help them get their bookkeeping business of the ground. She wanted a clean and modern logo that represented her main reason for starting the company&#58; to spend more time with her son. The final logo is based on a child's building block, while the arrows represent the financial cycle.
      
      To accompany the logo I chose a typeface pairing that would reflect the same values.  Nunito is used for the majority of the body copy and branding elements, as it maintains a generally balanced feel, with the round edges calling back to a child's font. The titles are set in Arapey, whic is modeled after older, more timeles fonts. Both are hosted on Google Fonts, ensuring the project stayed reasonable to the client's budget.

    paragraph: The brief was to use only primary colors in the palette, incorporate simple geometric shapes, and look good while staying conservative enough to fit into the world of bookkeeping.
