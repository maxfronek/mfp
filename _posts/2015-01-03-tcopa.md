    paragraph: Formerly the HORIPRO Music Academy, an ownership change was the perfect time to rebrand. Their brief was simple&#58; the new style had to be classic, trustworthy and adaptable enough to work for all the school's offerings. From summer camps for 3 year olds to high schoolers preparing for college, the style had to fit a range of applications.

    paragraph: I chose Optima as the main font for a few reasons. It has a presence and familiarity without being over-used, lending a certain trustworthiness to the brand. It also didn't feel too old-fashioned, and could be adapted to many different use cases. It feels like a serif font without the serifs, and that was perfect for The Conservatory.

    paragraph: The Conservatory had used bright yellow tables in their classrooms since its inception, and they weren't going anywhere. So I chose to present their branding on the signature color, showing that the new color scheme would complement it perfectly. The yellow shade in the logo is the exact same as the table. I call it Conservatory Yellow.

    paragraph: These poster templates allowed for a lot of freedom in design for various events, and were made with ease of use in mind so in-house team could quickly make them as needed. The photos used were photos of the students and staff I took as a part of the rebranding effort.
