      In 2017 Delta Air Lines partnered with LSTN Sound Co to create a line of noise-canceling headphones for all Delta One flights. The aim was to bring in a luxury brand that was also committed to making the world a better place, to set apart the in-flight offering when compared to other carriers.

      I led the design process for the headphones, as well as for the product presentation and supporting collaboration materials. As part of this collaboration LSTN also produced limited edition versions of their flagship headphones, the Troubadour, and hosted pop-up events in Delta Sky Clubs around the USA to promote the partnership and their headphones.

      The LSTN In-Flight model was featured on Delta One transcontinental flights from 2017 through 2019. I led the design process, working with both Delta's team and our overseas suppliers to bring the original design to life. It adapts LSTN's flagship Troubadour design to the rigorous standards required by Delta.

      During this partnership we also created a special line of matte black Troubadour headphones to be sent to Delta Air Line's elite "360" passengers. The scratch-resistant matte black aluminum headband helps give these headphones a more subtle look than the standard Troubadour, while plush vegan leather gives comfort on even the longest flights.
