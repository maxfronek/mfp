      Delta Air Lines partnered with LSTN to create a line of noise-canceling headphones for all Delta One flights, aiming to bring in a luxury brand committed to making the world a better place and setting apart their in-flight offering when compared to other carriers.

      As a part of this partnership, Delta sponsored a mission to the first place LSTN went with Starkey: Peru. We were able to help thousands of people receive hearing aids as a direct result of this partnership.

      I led the design process to bring an adapted version of LSTN's flagship design up to the rigorous standards required by Delta. The LSTN In-Flight model was featured on Delta One transcontinental flights from 2017 through 2019.

      During this partnership we also created a special line of matte black Troubadour headphones to be sent to Delta Air Line's elite "360" passengers. The scratch-resistant matte black aluminum headband helps give these headphones a more subtle look than the standard Troubadour, while plush vegan leather gives comfort on even the longest flights.
