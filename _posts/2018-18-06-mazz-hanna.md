      I handled the packaging and product identity, website design, and general branding for Mazz Hanna. I also took the product photos for their launch and for new product releases.
      
      The client's only request was that I make no changes to their existing logo. I was able to use elements from that logo to tie their designs together and create a unified brand identity.

      With both CBD and non-CBD products we needed a way to quickly differentiate the two. I used a geometric pattern and pastel color scheme for anything with CBD, creating a immediately recognizable difference with the ultra-minimal "clean" products.
