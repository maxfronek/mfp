    title: The founder herself is the hand model used for all products.
    paragraph: This client has both CBD and non-CBD products, and needed a way to differentiate the two quickly and obviously. I gave all CBD-infused products a line pattern inspiried by sacred geometry and a color that corresponds to the crystal infusion.

    paragraph: Conversely, any non-CBD product has a very clean style, and the color is used to accent the text instead of the box itself.

    title: Using the diamond
    paragraph: The client's only request was that I make no changes to the logo itself. I was fine with this, because I thought the combination of the A's in the name created the perfect motif to tie the product lines together. It carries through almost all elements of the design, from the website to the packaging to any other printed materials.

    title: The name of the crystal kit? The "Get Stoned" kit.
    blockquote: The client wanted to differentiate themselves from other companies in the space by maintaining an ultra-clean, ultra-sophisticated look.
