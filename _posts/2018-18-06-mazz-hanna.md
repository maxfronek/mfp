    blockquote: Mazz Hanna is one of the hardest-working people I've ever met, and I was elated when she asked me to design the brand identity for her latest project.
    paragraph: | 
      She quit a high-powered ad exec job to become a nail stylist, was immediately a success, and then decided to start her own CBD beauty line. I was elated when she asked me to come up with the design language for the new project, and I dove right in.
      
      Mazz's only request was that I make no changes to her logo. Luckily, she already had a great starting point, and I decided to use the diamond 'A' shape as a primary motif of the packaging.

    paragraph: This client has both CBD and non-CBD products, and needed a way to differentiate the two quickly and obviously. I gave all CBD-infused products a line pattern inspiried by sacred geometry and a color that corresponds to the crystal infusion. All non-CBD products are distinguished by a very clean style, and the color is used to accent the text, instead of on the box itself.

    blockquote: The client wanted to differentiate themselves from other companies in the space by maintaining a clean, ultra-sophisticated look.
    paragraph: |
      When looking at the CBD industry, the leading players have very different branding.  Lord Jones is very old-school apothecary, while Herb Essntls has the hipster market locked down, right to the no-vowel name. 
      
      Mazz Hanna wanted to be different, and use a high-fashion aesthetic. With her A-list clientele, having a product she could present during shoots and pre-show manicures was essential to the growth of her business.
