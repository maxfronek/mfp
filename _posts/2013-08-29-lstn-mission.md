    paragraph: I have been documenting LSTN Sound Co's charity missions since their first in 2013. I've been lucky enough to travel the world with them and see how they've helped more than 30,000 people receive hearing aids through their partnership with Starkey Hearing Foundation. The impact that their cause has on people's lives drives me to do the best job I can, and I enjoy every minute of being on the ground working with them.
