    title: Renders of Coast's products and packaging
    paragraph: |
      Coast needed modern, minimal, high end branding and they needed it yesterday. With only a rough sketch of the logo and a phone call to go off of, I set to work helping them get ready for launch.

      Coast needed two packaging styles&colon; a high-end retail box suitable for customers, and an inexpensive kraft cardboard version that would maintain brand standards at a fraction of the cost.

      With the branding and packaging complete, Coast also needed a launch video for their Kickstarter campaign.
