      I designed all aspects of LSTN's online identity from art direction to UI, and coded the theme from scratch in Shopify. The main goals were to echo their packaging design on the product pages, incorporate imagery and video as much as possible, and to ensure there was a clear user goal or call to action at all times.

      Since taking LSTN's pre-launch photos, I worked as the primary photographer for LSTN's brand. My shots have been used in just about any way possible&mdash;from packaging and ecommerce to full-size billboards.

      To accentuate the natural materials and premium product quality, LSTN's photography uses a pure white background and removes all distractions from the image. This allows the product to set itself apart in a sea of plastic headphones.

    paragraph: LSTN's design philosophy carried through to lifestyle imagery, emphasizing a clean midcentury-inspired aesthetic. Adding just a little L.A. flair was key, but as always, the product was the priority.

    paragraph: The Apollo holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first product I helped to design while working full-time for LSTN. Though manufacturing difficulties forced us to stop producing the Apollo after only a short time, the speaker received <a title="Gizmodo used my photography in this review of the Apollo" href="https://gizmodo.com/buy-this-wooden-speaker-help-a-deaf-person-hear-1756948892" target="_blank">rave reviews</a> for both its looks and sound quality.
