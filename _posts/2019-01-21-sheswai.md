    paragraph: |
      I designed the brand identity for Sheswai, a California-based beauty and wellness brand. They requested a clean and modern look that retained some homespun feel. They wanted to incorporate floral designs, the moon, and a 'California Cool' feel.
        
      I created the logo, product labels, insert materials, website, and overall style guide. The founder asked for the logo to be based off the shape of a heart, and to incorporate the cycle of the moon in some way. The two tail ends of the logo create the waxing and waning crescents, while the curves of the heart also echo the letter 'S', creating a bond between the company name and logo.

    paragraph: |
      Sheswai's product labels, content cards, and other deliverables use botanical illustrations, natural materials, and a minimal color palette of cream, sage and gold.  A foil deboss adds an eye-catching accent to product hang tags and business cards without being overdone or distracting. Combined, these elements hold to the premium yet homespun ethos of the brand.

      Inspired by vintage scientific illustrations, the different botanical drawings used show the ingredients that make up each product. Found on numerous branding elements, they unify all aspects of Sheswai's brand identity.

    paragraph: These content cards are included with Sheswai's two product kits. They walk the customer through the ritual of home cleansing, and help to build the experience of using the Sheswai product line.

    title: All Sheswai products are made according to the phases of the moon, making it a vital part of the brand
    paragraph: |
      Every Sheswai product is based around the lunar cycle, and the founder wanted a visual representation of that to help explain its importance to customers. The symbol shows an abstract version of the cycles of the moon, and uses the same curves and angles as the logo to maintain continuity.
