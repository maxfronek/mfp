      I designed the complete brand language and philosophy for Sheswai. They were rebranding in anticipation of a pivot to health and wellness. The client requested a clean and modern look that retained some homespun feel. She wanted to incorporate floral designs, the moon, and a 'California Cool' feel.
        
      I created the logo, product labels, packaging, insert materials, website, and overall style guide.

      I used public-domain botanical illustrations as the main design element, digitally editing them so they all matched in look and feel. I created pattern sheets using these illustrations to be used in packaging materials / tissue paper.
