    paragraph: |
      I designed the brand identity for Sheswai, a California-based beauty and wellness brand. They requested a clean and modern look that retained some homespun feel. She wanted to incorporate floral designs, the moon, and a 'California Cool' feel.
        
      I created the logo, product labels, insert materials, website, and overall style guide. One of my favorite moments of the design process is when the founder said she wanted to get a tattoo of the logo.

    title: I developed a print based on the floral illustrations from the labels and product packaging, creating an element that can be reused in many applications for Sheswai.

      Inspired by vintage scientific illustrations, the plant drawings on each label reflect the ingredients used to make each product, and unify different elements of Sheswai's brand identity.

    paragraph: These content cards are included with Sheswai's two product kits. They walk the customer through the ritual of home cleansing, and help to build the experience of using the Sheswai products.
