      I designed the complete brand language and philosophy for Sheswai. They were rebranding in anticipation of a pivot to health and wellness. The client requested a clean and modern look that retained some homespun feel. She wanted to incorporate floral designs, the moon, and a 'California Cool' feel.
        
      I created the logo, product labels, packaging, insert materials, website, and overall style guide. The main logo consists of two 'S' shapes combined to create a heart, using crescent moons as an overall accent. It modernized and simplified Sheswai's old logo into something that could work in any situation.

      I used botanical illustrations as the main design element, digitally editing them so they all matched in look and feel. I created pattern sheets using these illustrations to be used in various applications across deliverables, including packing tissue paper.
