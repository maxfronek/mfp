      This is a series of explorations I did for a proposed brewery based in the San Fernando Valley, CA. The brief was to create a clean, distinct, and direct brand that could create its own niche in th corwded craft beer community.

    paragraph:
    blockquote: Because the founders had come from all over the country to settle in the valley, they wanted to logo to reflect that. It also had to look elevated, unlike any other brewery's logo. The end result is a design inspired by a map of the SFV's major highways, honed down to its simplest form.

      Communicating the brand starts with the can â€“ it's the first thing most people will ever see. It has to present the brand clearly, stand out from other options, and leave a lasting impression.
    
      The can is clean and clear, standing out from the current crop of busy designs. The color and typography clearly announces the type of brew, demonstrating the clarity Deep Valley desired. A faded map of the San Fernando Valley adds local flair without overwhelming the minimal design.
    
      For limited editions and special runs, an inverted version of the can provides a distinct visual shorthand saying 'This is Something Different.' Early ideas presented included a date-brewed beer for Valentine's Day, a classic American Lager for Independence Day, and a Cinnamon Dessert Beer for the holidays.
