I've had a passion for design and photography for as long as I can remember. I love finding the perfect way to present information and solve problems creatively. I work with various clients to achieve their short- and long-term needs, focusing mainly on product branding, product and packaging development, marketing, and corporate identity.

My photography has been featured in numerous press outlets, and has been presented for advertising content in formats from magazines to billboards. Some places you may have seen my product photos include The Wall Street Journal, GQ, Esquire, Playboy, Gizmodo, Popsugar, and more. It has been used in everything from product packaging to billboards.
