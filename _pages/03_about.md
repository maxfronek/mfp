![Me]({{ page.image  | prepend:  site.baseurl }})



I love to solve problems creatively, and present information in the clearest way possible. My main areas of focus are corporate identity, branding, and photography, though I also have experience in product and packaging development, marketing, and animation. Whatever design needs you or your company may have, I'm sure we can find the best possible way to express your idea.
