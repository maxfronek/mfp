    paragraph: |
      I have been GOHUNT's Creative Director since October 2021, and in that time have led multiple design efforts across a diverse team and product set. GOHUNT's offering includes a SaaS platform, ecommerce storefront, content wing, and educational platform, and I've been intimately involved in the visual presentation and overall messaging of every part of it since starting. Whether as a team leader, stakeholder, or hands-on individual contributor, I'm always happy to roll up my sleeves and get the job done.

      My first project at GOHUNT was to lead a comprehensive brand refresh, modernizing the visual brand and storytelling voice of GOHUNT to reflect a more mature organization.

      There was just one untouchable brand element&#58; the diamond. Since it had special significance to the founder and his family, I put it at the center of the brand system as a single, unifying graphic.

      I worked directly with the founder to distill the company's core values and ethos into a single statement. He narrated this statement over evocative hunt footage to create the core anchor video for the rebrand.

      We developed a robust typographical system to serve GOHUNT's needs, applicable across the SaaS platform, ecommerce store, and marketing communications. As a genuine, trusted resource for the hunting community, we chose typefaces and treatments that were straightforward with no frills or fluff.

      GOHUNT's original films are a key driver to bring new people into the ecosystem. One of my first goals after starting was to eleveate these releases beyond simply dropping a video on YouTube. Each original is no accompanied by life premieres, original artwork, marketing and merch tie-ins, and more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSi_azl6Ipc&list=PLBbY7PGzu7VMwkFmibH39hgx8VLzDEIXH" target="_blank">View GOHUNT Originals on YouTube</a>

      GOHUNT also produces short-form content, aiming to help hunters broaden and develop their skills, learn about new gear, and engage with conservation efforts in the hunting community.
