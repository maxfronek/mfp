    paragraph: |
      I have been GOHUNT's Creative Director since October 2021, and in that time have led multiple design efforts across a diverse team and product set. GOHUNT's offering includes a SaaS platform, ecommerce storefront, content wing, and educational platform, and I've been intimately involved in the visual presentation and overall messaging of every part of it since starting. Whether as a team leader, stakeholder, or hands-on individual contributor, I'm always happy to roll up my sleeves and get the job done.

      When I began, GOHUNT was working with an agency to lead a rebranding effort and had run into a wall with communication and needs. I took over leadership of the project and successfully worked with the agency and our internal team to bring the project across the finish line.

      GOHUNT had one untouchable element&#58; the diamond. Holding special significance to the founder and his family, I put it at the center of the brand system as a single, unifying graphic.

      Across GOHUNT's verticals and content types, the variety of what we need to promote always keeps me on my toes and thinking of new ways to communicate with our audience while staying genuine to our brand values.

      GOHUNT's content arm is the 'tip of the arrow', bringing in new audiences and introducing the brand to hunters of all kinds. From full-length original films to podcasts, I am responsible for making sure the production tema is on point.

    paragraph: |
      GOHUNT's original films are our biggest driver of new people into the ecosystem. After starting, I ensured their releases were lock in with promotional graphics, in-person events, ecommerce tie-ins, and a full marketing launch. This not only helped us get the most out of who saw them, but increased the average views as well.
