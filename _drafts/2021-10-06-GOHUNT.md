      I have been GOHUNT's Creative Director since October 2021, and in that time have led multiple design efforts across a diverse team and product set. GOHUNT's offering includes a SaaS platform, Ecommerce storefront, content wing, and educational platform, and I've been intimately involved in the visual presentation and overall messaging of every part of it since starting.

      At GOHUNT I've worked as a team leader, stakeholder, and as a hands-on individual contributor when needed. When I began, GOHUNT was working with an agency to lead a rebranding effort and had run into a wall with communication and needs. I took over leadership of the project and successfully worked with the agency and our internal team to right the ship and bring the rebranding efforts across the finish line by our stated deadline.

    paragraph: The design brief only had one untouchable element&#58; the diamond icon. It held special significance to the founder and his family, and I was happy to hear it. I saw the entire brand system revolving around this single, unifying graphic, and set to work creating a new color structure and design language around it.

      Part of the challenge with designing Coast's packaging was the need for two separate versions; a full-color high quality gift box, as well as a more durable and sustainable kraft paper option. Using vector drawings inspired from the full-color packaging, I was able to create a seamless experience for ther customer regardless of what packaging they neded up receiving.
