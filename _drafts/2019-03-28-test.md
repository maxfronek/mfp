This is a post I'll use as a tesbed to make sure plugins, styles, and other shit is working properly. Maybe I'll get ambitious and hide it eventually but who knows. It will also serve as a reminder to future me on how to do things once I've moved on to other projects and forgetten how I did things here.  It will *also* serve as a way for me to learn how to write in .md language which on the surface seems way quicker than pure HTML so :happy face:

This should be a new paragraph. Let's see how paragraph links are styled. Here'a [a link to my Github](http://github.com/maxfronek). Here's a second link, this time to my [instagram][instagram]. Looking good now.  After this we'll try a default markdown image:

![Looking Good, Billy Ray]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/post_images/style_guide/lgbr.gif "Trading Places...Classic.")

Tight.  Fun fact: you get links and images similarily. Links are square brackets + parenthesis:

`[what the text says](/where/the/link/goes.html)`

And make that an image by putting an exclamation point before the link syntax, like this:

`![image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/path/to/image.jpg "here's a title")`

Double fun fact: you can add an image in the YAML at the top of any post and then call it using liquid that you know and love.  Watch the magic:

<code>&lbrace;&lbrace; page.image | prepend: site.baseurl &#125;&#125;</code>

{% for image in page.images limit: 1 %}
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/{{ image.img_url }}" alt="{{ image.title }}">
{% endfor %}
