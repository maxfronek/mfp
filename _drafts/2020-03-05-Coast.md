      Coast needed modern, minimal, high end branding and they needed it yesterday. With only a rough sketch of the logo and a phone call to go off of, I set to work. First on the list was a product launch video to be featured in Kickstarter campaigns and presentations.

      Coast's logo shows not only the two-part nature of the product, but also references a water droplet, creating a quick visual shorthand and helping to create a seamless bond between product and design.

      Coast asked for two types of packaging&#col; a high-end retail box suitable for customers, and an inexpensive kraft cardboard version that would maintain brand standards at a fraction of the cost. I ended up using diagrams and illustrations to replace the photographs on the retail box to keep messaging consistent and create a unique, cost-effective packaging experience.

      Part of the challenge with designing Coast's packaging was the need for two separate versions; a full-color high quality gift box, as well as a more durable and sustainable kraft paper option. Using vector drawings inspired from the full-color packaging, I was able to create a seamless experience for ther customer regardless of what packaging they neded up receiving.
