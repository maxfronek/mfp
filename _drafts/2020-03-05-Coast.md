      Coast needed modern, minimal, high end branding and they needed it yesterday. With only a rough sketch of the logo and a phone call to go off of, I set to work. First on the list was a product launch video to be featured in Kickstarter campaigns and presentations.

      The founders of Coast has a strong vision for the logo, wanting to reflect a water droplet to help reinforce the product's main selling point. The end result creates a quick visual shorthand and helps to create a seamless bond between product and design.

      The lightweight and clean typography used throughout brand collateral signify the cleanliness and "leave no trace" attitude of the product.

      Coast asked for two types of packaging&colon; a high-end retail box suitable for customers, and an inexpensive kraft cardboard version that would maintain brand standards at a fraction of the cost. I ended up using diagrams and illustrations to replace the photographs on the retail box to keep messaging consistent and create a unique, cost-effective packaging experience.

      I created these renders to help assist Coast in pre-launch sales to both vendors and the public.

      Part of the challenge with designing Coast's packaging was the need for two separate versions; a full-color high quality gift box, as well as a more durable and sustainable kraft paper option. Using vector drawings inspired from the full-color packaging, I was able to create a seamless experience for ther customer regardless of what packaging they neded up receiving.
