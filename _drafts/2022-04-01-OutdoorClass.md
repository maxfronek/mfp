      In early 2022 leaders in the hunting & outdoors space space got together to launch something unique in the industry: the only hunting skills-focused education platform. I was tasked with building the brand from the ground up and launching it to the world.

        I worked with the team at <a href="https://ohpartners.com" target="_blank">OH Partners</a> to create OutdoorClass' initial branding. Kurt Snider led the logo design, while I handled overall branding and typography. Together we were able to make something new and unique in the outdoor space.

    paragraph: The design brief only had one untouchable element&#58; the diamond icon. It held special significance to the founder and his family, and I was happy to hear it. I saw the entire brand system revolving around this single, unifying graphic, and set to work creating a new color structure and design language around it.
